sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I ran the random and sorted and compared it to the other algorithms, and I know that the Bubble Sort would be better than Selection if the scenario is already sorted, and because of that I discovered the answer.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: I knew that the Merge Sort would be way better in the random scenario, so knowing that and comparing it with others I discovered which one is the Merge, and I also knew that his behavior would be similar to the already sorted scenario.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: For the last, when I had the response and comparison of the other algorithms, it only lasted the Selection Sort.
